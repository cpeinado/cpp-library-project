```

## Building the Library
To build the library, you need to have CMake installed. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd cpp-library-project
   ```

2. Create a build directory:
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

3. Run CMake to configure the project:
   ```
   cmake ..
   ```

4. Build the project:
   ```
   cmake --build .
   ```

## Running Tests
To run the unit tests, ensure you have a testing framework set up (e.g., Google Test). After building the project, you can run the tests with the following command:
```
./tests/test_library
```

## Development Container
This project includes a development container configuration for a consistent development environment. To use the development container:

1. Open the project in a compatible editor.
2. Reopen the folder in the container when prompted.
